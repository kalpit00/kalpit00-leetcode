You are given an integer array nums and two integers lower and upper.

A missing integer is an integer in the inclusive range [lower, upper] that does not appear in nums.

Return a 2D integer array where each element is of the form [start, end], representing a contiguous range of missing integers. Return the ranges in increasing order. If there are no missing integers, return an empty array.

Note: Consecutive missing integers should be grouped into a single range.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,9,7], lower = 1, upper = 12

Output: [[1,2],[4,6],[8,8],[10,12]]

Explanation:


	The missing integers are [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12].
	Grouping the missing integers into the minimum number of contiguous ranges, we get [1, 2], [4, 6], [8, 8], and [10, 12].
	Therefore, the answer is [[1, 2], [4, 6], [8, 8], [10, 12]].



Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,1], lower = 5, upper = 7

Output: [[5,7]]

Explanation:


	The missing integers are [5, 6, 7].
	Grouping the missing integers into the minimum number of contiguous ranges, we get [5, 7].
	Therefore, the answer is [[5, 7]].



Example 3:


Input: nums = [2,3,5], lower = 2, upper = 3

Output: []

Explanation:


	There are no missing integers.
	Therefore, the answer is [].



 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 105
	1 <= lower <= upper <= 105
